                        Digital assets are digital representations of value, made possible by advances in cryptography and distributed ledger technology. These assets can be transferred peer-to-peer without requiring any intermediary involvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several other terms, such as cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, are also used in this developing market. There are a plethora of stakeholders involved within the digital assets realm such as miners, traders, entrepreneurs, and even corporations. Although the concert is fairly new, it offers an abundance of uses to users of all social classes.

                    <p>
                        A cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. Bitcoin is the most widely recognized cryptocurrency, while other, lesser known forms of cryptocurrency are referred to as altcoins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every cryptocurrency is issued on a blockchain, which is a system in which a record of transactions are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. For cryptocurrencies, supply and demand are the main drivers of their worth and the built-in limit to howmuch can exist, just like precious metals, should, in the long-term, prevent mass devaluation and inflation that's caused by central banks printing money that they don't have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. With decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

                        A Blockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions across thousands of computers at different times and it is the underlying technology that Bitcoin and most other digital assets use to record and validate transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using cryptographic languages, it is secure and transparent, and completely distributed and decentralized in its processing, which creates a decentralized database. For example, the Internet is centralized, which means that the power is under a central authority, making it not very secure and allowing for it to be hacked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The blockchain, on the other hand, is decentralized, which means that the power is moved away from the central authority and makes it impossible to be hacked. Through this, items such as ownerships, authenticities, and transaction histories can be transferred without the involvement of third-parties.

                    <p>
                        Bitcoin (₿) is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to create a digital asset that is entirely decentralized and managed across a wide network of computers rather than by a single entity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin is stored and transferred digitally in a virtual wallet and unlike cash, each bitcoin (lowercase b) has a public transaction history that makes it theoretically impossible to counterfeit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin addresses are easily generated using the peer-to-peer electronic cash system, which enables online payments to be sent and received. When a bitcoins transaction is initiated, a verification takes place to confirm that the transaction is legitimate and no double spending occurred.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This verification process is performed by Bitcoin Miners, who confirm the legitimacy of every transaction, which yields them a reward. People often purchase bitcoins due to desired anonymity, distrustment of banks, and the preference of transfering or storing their money in Bitcoin’s blockchain system. As time progresses, more and more retailers are starting to accept cryptocurrency.

                    <p>
                        Mining is a process in which transactions for various forms of cryptocurrencies are verified and added to the blockchain’s digital ledger. Miners are people who use special software to solve math problems on the cryptocurrencies’ network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mining software that is run works by grouping recent transactions into blocks, which are only accepted by the rest of the network if the block is hashed correctly, which requires the computer to find correct numerical values; a time consuming and computer intensive process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the block is hashed correctly, the miner that successfully processed the block adds it to the blockchain and the system generates a new coin that goes into the miners digital wallet or as a reward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since miners are required to approve Bitcoin transactions, this provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine because more miners means a more secure network.

                        In simpler terms, a message (input) is put through a hash function that gives the output called the hash value. The message is converted into an array of numbers and letters through an algorithm and even a change of one letter creates a significantly different hash value.

                    <p>
                        Hash functions are considered to be a type of one-way encryption because keys are not shared and the information required to reverse the encryption does not exist in the output.

                        A nonce, abbreviation for "number only used once", is a number added to a hashed block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions. The nonce is the number that blockchain miners are solving for. When the solution is found, the blockchain miners are offered cryptocurrency in exchange.

                    <p>
                        The objectives of smart contracts are to satisfy common contractual conditions, minimize malicious and fraudulent actions, and eliminate the need for trusted intermediaries. It can be built on top of these blockchains and in fact, is actually stored and executed inside the blockchain.

                    <p>
                        A fork is a condition where the state of the blockchain diverges in two different chains where one chain operates by different rules and the other. This can occur due to a discovery of a bug, upgrading features of the blockchain, and changes to the node software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soft forks are software updates to a digital asset blockchain, which do not result in a physical split of the blockchain into two digital assets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hard forks are rule changes that force the creation of a new digital asset, such as Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. In a hard fork, the data on the new chain is a duplicate of the old chain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means if you owned one Bitcoin before the hard fork, you now still own that one Bitcoin and one unit of currency on the new chain, Bitcoin Cash, after the hard fork.

                        Altcoins, an abbreviation for Alternative Coins, is any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin. Some examples of Altcoins are Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, etc. Altcoins are created to build on Bitcoin’s weaknesses (ex. Litecoin processes 56 transactions per second, while Bitcoin processes 7 transactions per second) or establish new uses for the blockchain.

                        ICO also known as Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry's equivalent to an Initial Public Offering (IPO). ICOs act as a way to raise funds, where a company looks to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service.

                    <p>
                        ICO’s allow investors to put money in early-stage companies and they allow the founders of those companies to crowdsource directly from their users. People who believe in the project can invest in it early and profit over time; once increased demand drives the price up. The money collected from ICOs is then typically used to fund project development.

                        Ethereum is an open software platform, which was constructed in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, using the blockchain platform that allows consumers and companies to build decentralized applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Ethereum’s blockchain, “ether” is the cryptocurrency that supports the network, which is similar to Bitcoin, but it can also be used as payment for code execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the user sends ether, they are able to interact with these self-operating computer programs, which will run the code without errors. Ethereum allows developers to build thousands of different applications that go beyond anything built on a blockchain before.

                    <p>
                        A DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization that runs on a blockchain using smart contracts and all the records and program rules of these organizations are kept there. The main idea was that all participants through voting could decide where the capital acquired at the ICO stage will be invested, which put more control in the investors' hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept received a lot of interest, raising over $168 million. The DAO software was hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, which meant that everyone, including hackers, could identify and exploit all possible loopholes in the system. Issues were discovered, but rather than addressing them, they were ignored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three weeks after the DAO token began trading on exchanges, an attack took place which took advantage of the vulnerabilities of the voting protocols, which resulted in over $50 million being stolen. Eventually, a hard fork was established and the DAO was taken off of all exchanges.

                        Byzantine Generals’ Problem

                    <p>
                        The Byzantine Generals’ Problem is a logical dilemma that displays how a group of generals may have communication problems when trying to agree on their next move.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The dilemma presumes that each general has his own army and that each group is situated in different locations around the city. The generals need to agree on either attacking or retreating. It does not matter whether they attack or retreat, as long as all generals reach consensus, they will be successful; but if a consensus isn’t reached, then they will fail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If applied to blockchains, each general represents a network note that needs to be in agreement on the current state of the system, which means that the majority of the participants in the network have to agree and execute the same action in order to avoid failures.

                        The Scalability Trilemma
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        A trilemma is a difficult choice from three options from which only two can be selected. The Scalability Trilemma is a term coined by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, that refers to three components: decentralization, security, and scalability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Decentralization refers to the degree of diversification in ownership. Security refers to the level of defensibility a blockchain has against attacks. Scalability dictates the eventual network capacity and determines the upper limit on how large a network can grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet, issues of infinite scalability arise due to tradeoffs. Scalability and decentralization can co-exist, but security risks become sizable on massive networks. Additionally, quickly growing networks will require a fast consensus mechanism, in order to validate more transactions while delivering the same speed to individual users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This can only occur in Proof of Stake or Delegated Proof of Stake, which compromises decentralization. If the protocol is Proof of Work, which would compromise scalability. If the hash puzzles or mining algorithms would become easier, in order to have a commensurately fast validation process, this would compromise security.

                        Ciphertext is information or data that has been encrypted using an encryption algorithm.

                    <p>
                        Encryption Algorithm (Cipher) is the formula used to encrypt/decrypt messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key is a number only known by the sender and receiver which allows them to encrypt/decrypt the message
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is the process of changing the message to hide the original text and is performed by the message sender. The primary purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of digital data transferred over the internet or stored on the computer. When an encrypted message is intercepted by an unauthorized user, the intruder has to guess which cipher the sender used to encrypt the message, as well as what keys were used as variables. The time and difficulty of guessing this information is what makes encryption such a valuable security tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Decryption is the process of unscrambling that message to make it readable and is performed by the message receiver.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Security Exposures occur when an unauthorized user has access to the plaintext encryption key and the cipher text.

                    <p>
                        Data Loss occurs if all copies of the decryption key are lost, which makes the associated ciphertext undecryptable.

                        Symmetric Encryption is a method of encryption where only one key, which is called a secret key, is used to encrypt information and decrypt the information. This is the fastest way to exchange information, yet if an unauthorized user intercepts the key, they are able to see the information.

                    <p>
                        Asymmetric Encryption is a method of encryption which uses two keys to encrypt a plaintext. A public key is made available to anyone who might want to send you something, while the private key is kept a secret so only you know what it is. A message that is encrypted using a public key can only be decrypted using the private key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simultaneously, a message encrypted using a private key can be decrypted using a public key. The public key can be given out to anybody since it cannot decrypt the information sent to the owner of the private key.

                        SHA-1 was the original hash function, but was later considered outdated with the release of SHA-2. SHA-2 consists of six hash functions where SHA-256 and SHA-512 are the most popular. SHA-256 takes a plaintext and encrypts it into a sequence of numbers and letters.

                        Even if one character in the message is added or deleted, the entire hash value will be completely different. Yet, a certain plaintext will always yield the exact same hash value. The only difference between SHA-256 and SHA-512 is that SHA-512’s hash value is double the length (SHA-256 is 32 bit & SHA-512 is 64 bit).

                        Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm that is used to validate transactions and broadcast new blocks to the blockchain. Miners on a network will compete against each other in solving complex computational puzzles.

                    <p>
                        These puzzles are difficult to solve but easy to verify the correct solution. Once a miner has found the solution to the puzzle, they will be able to broadcast the block to the network where all the other miners will then verify that the solution is correct.

                        Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. Unlike PoW, the creator of the next block is chosen through various combinations of random selections and wealth or age of investment.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, users in PoS are called forgers instead of miners. Users who want to participate in the forging process, are required to lock a certain amount of coins into the network as their stake. This is done to penalize anyone trying to harm the network by taking the money staked.

                    <p>

                        End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is an asymmetric encryption method of secure communication that prevents hackers and outsiders from accessing data while it's transferred from one end to another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In E2EE, the data is encrypted on the sender's device and only the recipient is able to decrypt it. When the encrypted message passes through the server, it is not able to decipher the message, thus passing it onto the receiver who can decrypt and see the message. Facebook’s WhatsApp is a prime example of E2EE.

                        DES, which stands for Data Encryption Standard, is an outdated symmetric key method of data encryption. DES works by using the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message, so both the sender and the receiver must know and use the same private key. DES has been superseded by the more secure AES algorithm. DES only had a 56 bit key, which made it quite easy to guess.

As of 2019, AES remains the most widely used file encryption software for the protection of electronic data throughout the world.

                    <p>Dear Clients!</p>
                    <p>As COVID-19 (the coronavirus) continues to impact the global community, we want to assure you that during these volatile market conditions your assets and cash held with ITI Capital continue to be protected under CASS rules. As a firm, ITI remains well capitalised. In addition, we are doing what we can to continue providing you with the service you require from us.</p>
                    <p>In the build up to the recent events, ITI began implementing a multi staged BCP plan for all our critical functions globally. Based on guidelines from regulators and global health authorities, we have taken a number of steps to ensure business continuity and help halt the spread of COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>As ITI is a digital business, we have taken advantage of our investments in technology so that employees can work remotely in a safe and effective way. We have been coordinating efforts with our partners and suppliers so that the running of our platforms will not be impacted.</p>
                    <p>As part of our third-party impact assessment at this time, we have been advised by our bankers that any funds received in the form of cheque, is likely to be delayed and/or may not be settled. Therefore, for us to continue you to provide you with the highest level of support within our daily operations, we strongly suggest we use electronic fund transfers to send in any money you wish to be applied to your account.
                        We have also instated strict travel policies and instructed all employees in how to conduct both external and internal meetings through digital tools.</p>
                    <p>As this is an unprecedented time for all of us, and the situation continues to evolve each day, we will continue to follow the situation closely, and update our approach and measures as required.</p>

                    <p>As part of this process, the vast majority of the SVS clients will become clients of ITI from the 11th of June, 2020.
